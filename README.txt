# bioValidatorDeploy
This repository contains downloadable application files for the legacy desktop application bioValidator.
We are no longer adding new projects to bioValidator but do support legacy projects (mainly biocode) for 
validation and updating data.  This repository is maintained for backwords for compatibility for those 
users who continue to use this.  Meanwhile, we suggest you check out our FIMS documentation at http://fims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
